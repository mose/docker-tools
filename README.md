docker-tools
============

A set of shell tools for easier docker playground.

Manual Install
---------------

To install the bash version, you can get .bash-docker and add to your .bashrc

    source .bash-docker

(zsh version in preparation)

Auto install
---------------

If you trust me (or if you are mose itself). But really, prefer manual install, as a matter of habit, or read the source of the install script carefully to see if it fits you.

    curl  -H "Cache-control: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mose/docker-tools/master/install-bash.sh | bash

Usage
------------

    docker-tools

This will list available commands provided by that toolbox.
